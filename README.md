# OOP_Cloning
## Correct cloning of objects with copy-constructor or function clone  

and asking  
 * if one object is  equal   to another object (IsEqual) and  
 * if one object is the same as another object (IsSame)  
 
in most OOP-languages you have a object-constructor for first creation of an object and for first initialization of necessary properties of an object in one line of code,
and a copy-constructor for cloning resp copying the complete state of all properties of one object into another new object also in one line of code.
In Classic Visual Basic we do not have the convenience of a language built-in constructor, but this does not mean we have to disclaim about it.
Of course we can write our own object initialization constructor and object cloning functions for every class.
